# Western Etiquette

> 2019-08-14

#### Introduction

The lecture delivered by Mr. Casimir d’Angelo was about western etiquette.

#### Reflection

I learned that there is a lot of differences between cultures,. Even in the west, it differs in many countries.

#### Discussion

There are so many cultures in the world, and we can not say which is right and which is wrong. What we should do is to respect the cultures and behave proper in front of the people.

#### Conclusion & Application

I am Uyghur and I know how a behavior can embarrass someone. What we need to do is to respect the cultures.
